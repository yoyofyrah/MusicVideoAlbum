I wanted an interesting way to showcase an album I made of eclectic Jungle, DnB, and Jersey Club tracks. Godot was so much fun to use to make this with.

The music was made using 90% Korg Gadget with vocal recording and mixing in Logic Pro. 

The videos were made using Visual Synthesizer for iPad.

I hope you enjoy :)
